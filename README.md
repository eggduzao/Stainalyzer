### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

#### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository from GitHub:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stainalyzer.git
$ cd stainalyzer
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
To keep dependencies isolated, it is recommended to create a virtual environment:

```bash

## Methodology

Stainalyzer uses the GhostNet Neural Network. The basic fundaments is as follows.

### Latent Stochastic Process

We define the generative process as a **stochastic differential equation (SDE)**:

The stochastic differential equation governing the process is:

```math
d\mathbf{z}_t = \mu(\mathbf{z}_t, t) dt + \sigma(\mathbf{z}_t, t) d\mathbf{W}_t,
```

where:

```math
\mathbf{z}_t
```
is the latent representation at time \( t \), 

```math
\mu(\mathbf{z}_t, t)
```
is the drift term,

```math
\sigma(\mathbf{z}_t, t) ,
``` 

is the diffusion coefficient, and 

```math
\mathbf{W}_t ,
```

is a Wiener process modeling Brownian motion.


The transition density of the process is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation:

```math
\frac{\partial p(\mathbf{z}, t)}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\mu(\mathbf{z}, t) p(\mathbf{z}, t)) + \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 (\sigma^2(\mathbf{z}, t) p(\mathbf{z}, t)).
```

### Variational Inference

The encoder network approximates the posterior \( q_\phi(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x}) \) via the **reparameterization trick**:

```math
\mathbf{z} = \mu_\phi(\mathbf{x}) + \sigma_\phi(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I).
```

The evidence lower bound (ELBO) is:

```math
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x})} \left[ \log p_\theta(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{z}) \right] - D_{KL} \left( q_\phi(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x}) || p(\mathbf{z}) \right).
```

### Diffusion Model Integration

The forward process gradually adds Gaussian noise to the latent space:

```math
q(\mathbf{z}_t | \mathbf{z}_0) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z}_t; \alpha_t \mathbf{z}_0, \sigma_t^2 I),
```

where \( \alpha_t \) and \( \sigma_t \) define the noise schedule. The reverse process learns to denoise step-by-step:

```math
p_\theta(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} | \mathbf{z}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z}_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t)).
```

### Training and Optimization

We minimize the variational loss function:

```math
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \lambda_{\text{VAE}} \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi) + \lambda_{\text{diff}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{diffusion}},
```

where the diffusion loss is given by:

```math
\mathcal{L}_{\text{diffusion}} = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{z}_t} \left[ || \mathbf{z}_t - \mu_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t) ||^2 \right].
```
