Stainalyzer Core Main Module
====================================================================================================

Overview
--------

- When you run 'python -m stainalyzer this script is called as a one-
  click entry point for headless execution.

- It loads your batch-processing workflow,  and executes your default 
  pipeline seamlessly.

- This file should remain: **minimal**, **clean**, and **fierce**. As
  it is the top-level executable face of the package.


Intended Use Cases
-------------------
- Placeholder.
- Placeholder.

Key Features
-------------
1. **Modularity and Reusability:** The utilities are designed as independent, reusable functions and classes, 
   making them suitable for various projects without modification.
2. **Configurable and Extensible:** The design allows easy extension of functionality through subclassing and 
   dynamic configuration loading.
3. **Performance-Oriented Implementations:** Where performance is critical, optimized algorithms and 
   vectorized operations (e.g., via NumPy) have been employed.
4. **Robust Error Handling:** Defensive programming practices ensure that potential runtime exceptions, 
   such as file I/O errors and data integrity violations, are properly managed and logged.
5. **Integration with External Libraries:** Seamless interoperability with popular libraries like `pandas`, 
   `numpy`, `pyyaml`, and `logging`, ensuring compatibility with established Python ecosystems.

Examples of Usage
-------------------
The following examples illustrate the versatility of the utilities provided within this module:

**Example 1: Placeholder**

```python

```

Development Notes:
-------------

 - Python Compatibility: Python 3.10 and above.

 - Required Packages: NumPy, SciPy and Open-Cv2.
 
 - Testing Framework: The module includes unit tests implemented using pytest to ensure reliability
across different Python environments.
 
 - Code Style Compliance: All code follows PEP 8 guidelines, with additional comments to aid
maintainability for future developers.
