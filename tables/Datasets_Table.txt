NeurIPS Challenge	1.679	0	0	0	515	421	280	0	0	463	0	0	This is the official data set for the NeurIPS 2022 competition: cell segmentation in multi-modality microscopy images.	This is an instance segmentation task where each cell has an individual label under the same category (cells). The training set contains both labeled images and unlabeled images. You can only use the labeled images to develop your model but we encourage participants to try to explore the unlabeled images through weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning.
TissueNet	10.075	0	0	0	0	0	0	6.038	1.923	0	1.730	2.114	A principal challenge in the analysis of tissue imaging data is cell segmentation—the task of identifying the precise boundary of every cell in an image. To address this problem we constructed TissueNet, a dataset for training segmentation models that contains more than 1 million manually labeled cells, an order of magnitude more than all previously published segmentation training datasets.	"Annotations: CODEX: 350k cell; CyCIF: ~325K cell; Vectra: ~250K cell; MIBI: ~225K cell; MxIF: ~110K cell; IMC: ~50K cell"

PanNuke	7.901	0	7.901	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	PanNuke is a semi automatically generated nuclei instance segmentation and classification dataset with exhaustive nuclei labels across 19 different tissue types. The dataset consists of 481 visual fields, of which 312 are randomly sampled from more than 20K whole slide images at different magnifications, from multiple data sources. In total the dataset contains 205,343 labeled nuclei, each with an instance segmentation mask.	Please note that the dataset was created by extracting patches from whole-slide images (WSIs). As a result, some nuclei located at the edges of patches may be cropped, with fewer than 10 visible pixels in certain cases.
